# Feature Suggestions

Based on the current app flow (area selection → enrichment → filtering → contact extraction → reconnaissance), here are potential enhancements organized by category.

## Data Management & Export

- **Export functionality**: CSV/JSON/Excel export of filtered business lists with all contact info
- **Saved projects**: Name and save polygon sets with their enriched data (e.g., "Downtown Hotels Q1 2026")
- **Comparison view**: Compare two areas side-by-side (useful for market analysis)
- **Batch operations**: Select all entities in a category at once for recon

## Enhanced Filtering & Search

- **Compound filters**: Combine filters (e.g., "Retail + has phone + has website")
- **Saved filters**: Save frequently used filter combinations
- **Text search**: Search businesses by name across all loaded areas
- **Exclusion filters**: "Show everything except X" capability
- **Distance filters**: "Within X km of point Y"

## Data Enrichment Extensions

## Analysis & Visualization

- **Heat maps**: Business density by category
- **Market saturation analysis**: Identify underserved areas

- **Statistics panel**: Quick stats on loaded area (avg distance between entities, category distribution)

## Collaboration Features

- **Shareable links**: Share a polygon + filters with teammates

- **Assignment**: Assign businesses to team members for follow-up

## UI/UX Improvements

- **Polygon templates**: Quick circles for common radii (500m, 1km, 5km)
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Q for draw, C for circle, Esc to cancel, etc.
- **Multi-select in tables**: Shift+click, Ctrl+click in list view
- **Recent locations**: Quick jump to previously searched locations
- **Undo/redo**: For polygon operations

## Reconnaissance Enhancements

- **Scheduled recon**: Re-run recon periodically to track changes
- **Diff view**: Show what changed since last recon
- **Threat scoring**: Flag entities with suspicious infrastructure patterns
- **Bulk email validation**: Verify email deliverability
- **Technology detection**: What CMS, hosting, CDN they use

## Questions to Consider

- What's the primary use case? (market research, sales prospecting, security research, etc.)
- Is this single-user or multi-user/collaborative?
- What's the typical area size being analyzed?
- What's the typical number of entities per area?
- Is offline/export capability critical?
